 - Clean up and organize packages
   + Enable cross-dependencies for late-added packages (libvdpau for example)
   + Re-order package build process to minimize package substitution (i.e. if libfoo is needed and its built locally, make it the first install and not an update)
   + Fix a few errors that required disabling some things (flite, quvi...)
 - Double check all specs to include "Obsoletes" for those that update AMZ1 packages
 - Remove debug package from all specs
 - Add static packages to all specs
 - Write an automated build script
