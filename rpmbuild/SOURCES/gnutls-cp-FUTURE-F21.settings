# A level that will provide security on a conservative level that is
# believed to withstand any near-term future attacks. That will be
# an 112-bit security level, without including protocols with known
# attacks available (e.g. SSL 3.0). This level may prevent communication
# with many used systems that provide weaker security levels (e.g.,
# systems that use SHA-1 as signature algorithm).

# MACs: SHA1+
# Curves: of size 256+ or better
# Signature algorithms: must use SHA-256 hash or better
# Ciphers: AES-GCM, AES-CBC, CAMELLIA-GCM, CAMELLIA-CBC
#   (Note that AES256 should be prioritized after AES128 to conserve resources.)
# Key exchange: ECDHE, RSA, DHE
# DH params size: 2048+
# RSA params size: 2048+
# Protocols: TLS1.2+
