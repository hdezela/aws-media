# This file should contain a single keyword, the crypto policy to
# be applied by default to applications. The available policies are 
# restricted to the following profiles.
#
# * LEGACY: ensures maximum compatibility with legacy systems (64-bit
#   security)
#
# * DEFAULT: A reasonable default for today's standards (80-bit security).
#
# * FUTURE: A level that will provide security on a conservative level that is
#   believed to withstand any near-term future attacks (128-bit security).
#
# After modifying this file, you need to run update-crypto-policies
# for the changes to propagate.
